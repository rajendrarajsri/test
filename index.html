                This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> (located at
                <tt>/var/www/html/index.html</tt>) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.
          </p>


          <p>
                If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
                maintenance.
                If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.
